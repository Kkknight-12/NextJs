"watch": An array of file patterns that nodemon will watch for changes. In this case, it's watching server.ts, all TypeScript files in src/collections/ and its subdirectories, and src/trpc/index.ts.

"exec": The command that nodemon will run when it starts and every time it detects a change in the watched files. Here, it's using ts-node to run src/server.ts with the TypeScript configuration from tsconfig.server.json.

"ext": The file extensions that nodemon should monitor for changes. Here, it's watching for changes in JavaScript and TypeScript files.

"stdin": If set to false, nodemon will not restart the script if it receives input from stdin. In this case, it's set to false, so nodemon will not restart on stdin input.
